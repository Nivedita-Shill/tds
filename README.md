# Customer Retention Analysis — 2024 (Quarterly)

**Author / Verification email:** 24f1001642@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Summary
This repository contains an LLM-assisted analysis of customer retention for 2024 (quarterly data). The goal is to diagnose the decline in retention and recommend actions to reach the industry target retention rate of **85%**.

**Quarterly data (2024):**
- Q1: 66.87
- Q2: 72.03
- Q3: 69.37
- Q4: 73.56

**Average:** **70.46**

**Recommended solution (high level):** *implement targeted retention campaigns*

## What’s included
- `analysis.py` — Python script that:
  - computes the average retention (70.46),
  - generates a publication-quality trend chart (`retention_chart.png`),
  - writes `results.json` and `summary.txt`.
- `retention_chart.png` — 512×512 visualization produced by the script (commit will include it).
- `results.json` and `summary.txt` (generated by script).

## Key findings
1. **Low average retention**: Average retention is **70.46%**, which is **14.54 percentage points below** the industry target of 85.
2. **Quarterly volatility**: Q4 shows the best quarter (73.56) but still well below target. Q1 is the weakest (66.87).
3. **Small upward trend but insufficient**: While Q2 and Q4 show improvements, gains are modest and inconsistent.

## Business implications
- At current retention, customer lifetime value (CLV) and recurring revenue will be materially lower than peers meeting the 85% benchmark.
- Marketing and product teams must prioritize retention-focused investments (personalization, lifecycle programs, win-back campaigns).
- If left unaddressed, the gap will compound and increase acquisition cost pressure to maintain revenue.

## Recommended action plan (to reach 85)
1. **Implement targeted retention campaigns** (primary recommendation)
   - **Segment customers** by recent purchase cadence, monetary value, and churn risk (e.g., using last purchase, recency, and product lines).
   - **Design micro-campaigns**: personalized offers for at-risk customers (discounts, recommended products, exclusive perks).
   - **Automate lifecycle journeys**: onboarding, post-purchase follow-ups, and re-engagement sequences.
   - **Test & learn**: A/B test messaging, offers, and timing; measure lift in retention by cohort.
2. **Improve product/experience touchpoints**
   - Remove UX friction, improve delivery/fulfillment communication, and address common complaints.
3. **Measure and monitor**
   - Create a retention dashboard with weekly updates and cohorts (7/30/90-day retention).
   - Set KPIs: 3-month rolling retention improvement target (e.g., +4 pts per quarter).
4. **Cross-functional retention squad**
   - Form a small team (marketing + product + data) to run continuous experiments focused on retention.

## LLM assistance & provenance
- Analysis and code generation assisted by **Jules (ChatGPT Codex)** / similar LLM tools; commit messages will indicate LLM involvement for audit.
- The script (`analysis.py`) was written to be reproducible and to show exactly how the average (70.46) and chart are produced.
